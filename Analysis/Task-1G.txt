Results Comparison between URLs crawled using BFS and DFS Search techniques:

URL OVERLAP : 31 URLs overlapped in BFS and DFS Crawl.

QUALITY AND EFFECIENCY ASPECT : 
					Runtime for BFS  : ~ 24.03 mins 
					Maximum Depth Reached  : 3
					Runtime for DFS  : ~ 24.33 mins
					Maximum Depth Reached : 6
					
Efficiency (in terms of time required) :  BFS and DFS crawl takes almost same time
					  to crawl the web and fetch the links
					  where no search is been performed
												
																						
Efficiency (in terms of proximity to search topic): Since BFS searches at shallower depth	
   						    the topics searched are closely related	
						    in case of BFS but not the same in DFS
					

COVERAGE OF CRAWLED TOPICS : The URLs  crawled in BFS are at a shallower depth and therefore 
			     very closely related to the topic of search i.e solar eclipse
			     whereas the URLs crawled in DFS deviate from the given topic.
			     Analyzing starting 10-15 URLs in BFS Crawl suggests that the URLs contain topics
			     such as 'Solar_prominence', 'Corona', 'Moon','Occultation', 'Sun'
			     and so on whereas topics that DFS Crawl gives are 'Invention','Rhodes','Midsummer'
       			    'Arabic_language' deviate the focus of the topic been searched
