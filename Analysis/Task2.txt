Task2 : Focused BFS Crawling

1.	The keywords "moon" and "lunar" are matched against the hyper-link string or the anchor text in an anchor tag
	using a search method available in regular expression library (re in python) which checks to find the 
	given keywords ("moon" ,"lunar") using a regular expression 
	Ex.	re.search(r'.*{0}.*'.format('moon'), seed_url, re.IGNORECASE) searches the keyword 'moon' in the raw format
	of the given string to be matched with the text in the seed_url by ignoring cases.
	
2.	If a URL hyper-link or its anchor text matches with any of these given keywords , then those URLs are added to the 
	list of BFSFocusedUrls.txt, but if the url has no such match, then  the url is further crawled to find all the 
	links that match  the pattern.

3.	The links are crawled starting at depth 1 (seed), if the seed has a match with the pattern , then the it is considered,
	and if it does not have a match, it is crawled to find all the urls that match the pattern.Then at depth 2, these urls(urls matched pattern)
	are crawled and continues until a depth of 6 or max url count of 1000 is reached.
